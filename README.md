# payment-methods README

## Overview

Welcome to the README for my Rails project! ðŸš€ This project is built using Rails version 7.1.3 and Ruby version 3.2.2. It utilizes Tailwind for styling and incorporates various testing tools such as Rubocop, RSpec, and WebMock/RSpec. Additionally, it uses `net/http` and `uri` to interact with external APIs, specifically the Kobana API service.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide functionality for managing boletos (payment slips) on the platform using the Kobana API. Users can create, delete, update, and edit boletos through the provided API endpoints.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Ruby 3.2.2 installed.
3. Install Rails 7.1.3 if you haven't already.
4. Run `bundle install` to install project dependencies.
5. Set up your API token:
   - If you have your own Kobana API token, replace `yvjdS4XepSEM5Sen-I63oBAW6Dq75XIZR0Uv0A244cY` directly in the code.
   - For testing purposes, you can use the provided token `yvjdS4XepSEM5Sen-I63oBAW6Dq75XIZR0Uv0A244cY`.
6. Initialize the server using `./bin/dev` command due to Tailwind setup.
7. You're ready to start developing!

## API Documentation

### Overview

This project integrates with the Kobana API service. Below is a brief overview of the API documentation:

- **Format:** The API accepts JSON format for all requests.

- Requests to port 80 are automatically redirected to port 443.
- TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 protocols are required.
- Supported ciphers are listed for secure communication.

For more security information, refer to the API documentation.

### Error Handling

- Specific error codes and handling recommendations are provided.
- It is the responsibility of the application to handle and retry requests in case of errors.

For server status updates and maintenance information, visit the Kobana status page.
